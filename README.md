# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms
1. Problems and solutions about data structure and algorithms which may come from interview, leetcode, geeksforgeeks. I'm sure that the details of problems and ideas are absolutely helpful for everyone who wants to be good at CS.
2. This project consists of several folders, each of them belongs to a sub-area of data-structure-and-algorithms. This division may not be so complete and reasonable, so I will update it as every other day as possible. Every cpp file contains the detailed description of the problem and idea. It is these detailed description that are different from other explanations about data-structure-and-algorithms.
3. In short, wish you learn something useful from this project and be free to contact with me if any problem exists!
